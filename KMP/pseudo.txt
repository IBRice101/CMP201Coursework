input:
	an array of characters, haystack (the text to be searched)
	an array of characters, needle (the word sought)
output:
	an array of integers, pos (positions in haystack at which needle is found)
	an integer, numPos (number of positions)

define variables:
	an integer, hayPos = 0 (the position of the current character in haystack)
	an integer, needPos = 0 (the position of the current character in needle)
	an array of integers, table (the table, computed elsewhere)

let numPos = 0

while hayPos < length(haystack) do
	if needle[needPos] = haystack[hayPos] then
		let hayPos = hayPos + 1
		let needPos = needPos + 1
		if needPos = length(needle) then
			(occurrence found, if only first occurrence is needed, m = hayPos - needPos  may be returned here)
			let pos[numPos] = hayPos - needPos, numPos = numPos + 1
			let needPos = table[needPos] (table[length(needle)] can't be -1)
	else
		let needPos = table[needPos]
		if needPos < 0 then
			let hayPos = hayPos + 1
			let needPos = needPos + 1
